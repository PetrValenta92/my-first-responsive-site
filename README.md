## Overview

### The project

The site is built with:

- Responsive design
- Mobile first approach
- Functional links to other pages

### How to use the site

It's simple. üòâ An user opens the site via the link https://petrvalenta92.github.io/my-first-responsive-site/ on his/her smartphone or computer.
The navigation will takes him/her to the different sections of the page. S/he can click on different links to get to related pages.
If the user wants to see the design of the page, he/she can use the "Dev Tools", which can be accessed using the F12 key (or by pressing the right mouse button and selecting "Inspect").

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS pseudoclasses
- Flexbox
- Flex Wrap
- Mobile first
- Responsive design
- Media queries
- Relative units

### What I learned

I have had created this page based on the project I created during the lesson _Module 6 - Responsive site_.
Then I modified the page topic, added new color custome properties, add new suitable fonts and included links to related web pages.
I added a few breakpoints to make the site even more user-friendly.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to update the Teams section layout with GRID technology to be more responsive.
