## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS pseudoclasses
- Flexbox
- Flex Wrap
- Mobile first
- Responsive design
- Media queries

### What I learned

I built the project based on the provided design Figma template. First I have had prepared the HTML and CSS part of the app on which I was able to practice my knowledge of semantic HTML5 and CSS. For easier work with layout I used Flexbox several times. Also I used the custom properties for easier work with colors and its oppacity. For the buttons I have used different pseudoclasses to enrich the user's experience.
Then I wrote the JavaScript part of the app. There I used mostly the new knowledge which I have had learned from _Module 5 - Essential JavaScript concepts_

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to update the layout to be responsive! Also I would like to get involved with possible "meal deal" offers. A discount will appear based on combinations of meals ordered. I would also like to link the app to a local database. This will store orders, assign them identification numbers, collect customer information and then offer them the same meals as the last order.
